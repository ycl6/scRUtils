# scRUtils: Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis Utilities

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively 
developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`scRUtils` provides various utilities for visualising and functional analysis of RNA-seq data,
particularly single-cell dataset. It evolved from a collection of helper functions that were
used in our in-house scRNA-seq processing workflow.

## Installation

The package is current available only on [GitHub](https://github.com/ycl6/scRUtils).

``` r
devtools::install_github("ycl6/scRUtils")
```

## Load packages

To use `scRUtils` in a R session, load it using the `library()` command.

``` r
library(scRUtils)
```
